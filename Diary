I totally forgot about the diary, but it is a good thing I remembered. So, yeah time managaement was thrown out the window on this one. 
I told myself to do it on the weekend, but I am really unmotivated and checked out. I think this is one of the worst cases of unmotivation
and slight depression I have had. I find myself not caring about a lot of things and I beleive that mostly stems from not going to school
in person. Not seeing everyone and having that comraderie in a classroom is getting to me, especially since none of my close friends
and family actually understand what is we do. They mainly just cheer me on when I actually want to have an engaging and productive
conversation about the difficulties of the homework without reaching out to my classmates.

However, on a brighter note, I reached out to my classmates and we had conversations about the milestone. I was able to figure out what 
to do. When they told me it might be helpful to make a helper function to get the tiles, I was so grateful because I always forget about
making helper functions. I always just want to go line for line with what I need to do, incorporating what could be a helper function
into the main code. 

I am having a problem with the end tile, or more specifically making the endtile whatever tile the mouse hovers over. I am going to either 
figure it out tonight or have to ask tomorrow. I am definietly in a more productive state of mind. Mainly because the desire to not fail
is starting to drive me forward.
